# PyChina Logo 设计

基本思路：颜色采用和Python官方logo一致的黄色和蓝色，加强VI的识别度。形状上用和中国相关的一些元素。

## 概念草图

### 关键词：Python, 太极

这是蚂蚁自己最喜欢的概念。就像The Zen of Python，禅道一体，简单实用。

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### 关键词：Python, 中国结

和中国有关，但中国结本质是编造一个复杂的图形，蚂蚁觉得不Pythonic.

### 关键词：Python，龙

Python中文社区目前的Logo，龙在西方文化里不是正能量的代表。
