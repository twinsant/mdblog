# Require.js with Tornado

In Tornado 3.1, compute_etag was added.

> compute_etag sets the Etag header based on static url version.

  This allows efficient If-None-Match checks against cached versions, and sends the correct Etag for a partial response (i.e. the same Etag as the full file).

So it's important to configure the module file:

    require.config({
        urlArgs: 'bust=1'
    })

to load the changed files.
