# Startup (1)
> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important thing I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life, because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important... Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.  <p class="text-right">- Steve Jobs</p>

为什么？

有人喜欢挖矿追逐一夜暴富，有人耐心种花修饰居家温馨。各有各的选择。

你以为你热爱许多，但死亡是一个永久筛去一切浮华的筛子，在它面前，你发现你热爱的人和事屈指可数。

创业开始，唯有爱与死去。
