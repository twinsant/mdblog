# 创业日记一

> <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family:Century Schoolbook L, serif;margin-bottom:1em;">Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important thing I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life, because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.<p>

> <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family:Century Schoolbook L, serif;margin-bottom:1em;">Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>

创业开始，唯有爱与死去。
