# motor MotorClient open_sync will lost tornado pretty logging

In my main.py, I'm using motor:

    ...
    motor_client = motor.MotorClient().open_sync()
    ...
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        ...
        parse_command_line() # call enable_pretty_logging
        ...

Because motor start a private iolloop in open_sync, and ioloop.start may reset logging config:

    ...
    def start(self):
        if not logging.getLogger().handlers:
            ...
            logging.basicConfig()
    ...

The pretty logging will be lost if you wrote code like me.

So I just hacked commentting `logging.basicConfig()` to recover my pretty logging.
