# Download Pixelmator tutorial videos on Vimeo

Because could NOT use GIMP smoothly under Mac OS X, just buy [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/).

And will watch tutorials to getting started.

Write a [python script to download the Pixelmator tutorial videos](https://github.com/twinsant/savevideo).

It's a good idea to wath them on my mobile phone, isn't it?
